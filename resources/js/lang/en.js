All that awaits you is the embrace of death.” You ready your weapons. You can hardly see through the blizzard, but you are determined to make sure death embraces someone else. As quickly as you can, you escape the rising storm of ice to find some semblance of shelter in a cave. Upon seeing a glowing white orb behind the crytalline demons, the pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking your passage to the peak. After destroying the orb, pieces fall to the snowy floor along with the corpses of the enemies who stood in your way. The screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak.

You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you. “You dare approach my nest?” You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. “I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!” After battling the demon it screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak.

You make your way to the Echo Chamber, and, before the Voice can speak another word, you raise up the scepter and channel its power. A black fog oozes from it and envelops you.

Thankfully you are able to save this village."

The guards who are still alive scatter, and you return to the demon-ruled Gloomhaven victorious. “So you have crushed the pathetic upstarts?” You stand before one of the Prime Demon’s liaisons. “Good. You have proven yourselves an incredibly effective tool, and my master will compensate you greatly for your service.”"

The rebels seem wary at first, but they eventually open up. “To tell you the truth,” the rebel captain says, “we are in desperate need of your help. We’ve spent all our resources constructing a cannon capable of punching through Gloomhaven’s walls, but once that is accomplished, we don’t have the numbers or arms necessary to engage the demon force and drive them out of our home.” The captain unfurls a map of the city onto a table. “But you could be our secret weapon. Three days later, once the rebels are able to get their cannon into position, you sneak into the Ghost Fortress, preparing to take the armory. You decide a two-pronged assault will be the best way to get your hands on the weapon caches quickly. You hear the distant explosion of the cannon and spring into action. You secure the last of the armory stock just as the rebel fighters break through into the fortress. Cleaning out the demons from the rest of the building becomes short work after that. With a strong foothold in the town and the populace on your side, the tide quickly turns against the demons. The battle is still long and difficult, as more forces continue to arrive from the elemental plane, but it ultimately only brings the residents of Gloomhaven into stronger unison, fighting against a common enemy. And with you no longer fighting for them, the demon force eventually relents and retreats back to its own plane. The next weeks are difficult, as the citizenry rebuilds the walls and everything else that had been destroyed in the prolonged battle. They also need time to trust you again after your ill-conceived betrayal. But Gloomhaven does bounce back in time. It is full of resilient people and the port is vital for trade. It never feels quite the same afterward, but at some point, it at least still feels like home."

The Aesther ushers you outside, where you see a massive black column of smoke to the northeast. “There is no time!” She hands you a small pouch filled with what feels like sand and small rocks. “This should protect you from the worst of the Void’s influence. You must find him there and stop him from returning this world to ash.” As you approach the black column, it becomes clear that it is not smoke but a whirlwind of black sand extending far into the sky. The tremors continue, but you race towards the vortex as quickly as you can. The pouch fills you with a dull numbness. “Those brave enough to enter here will be the first torn apart.” An arresting voice echoes through the chamber around you. “The rest I will hunt down like game and devour, but I do think I will enjoy this more.” As your eyes adjust to the low light, you see a shadowy form in the center of the room. With time, you are able to focus on the image of an Aesther with two long, thin blades. “I have waited many years to reap this harvest,” he says with a wicked grin. “At one time, I had convinced myself that I would find more delight in watching you slowly kill yourselves, but with my meddling brethren and the deaths of my wards, I have returned to my original design. “I am not unhappy at the development. Even the patience of an immortal has its limits.” The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance. “Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?” Two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face. “How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?” The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings. “You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!” At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence. The dull pain subsides, and you ascend the staircase to a bright, clear sky. The tremors and vortex of black sand are gone and all those gathered around the Void look very relieved when you emerge from the confrontation. You let the people know that whatever calamity had descended upon them has now been averted. They cheer and celebrate your strength."
