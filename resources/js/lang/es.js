The monster is difficult to strike, but eventually the headless spectre screams as you land one final strike against it, and it's form dissipates in a gruesome way. Redthorn appears out of the thinning fog. “I don’t know how you did it, but I can already feel the forest lighten. It will take a long time, but I think the heart of the forest may one day be restored."

If you want to know more about the artifact, you may want to visit these locations. One such location is high atop the Copperneck Mountains.",
                2: "You climb the frozen peaks of the Copperneck Mountains, lamenting that every location Hail has sent you is in the most unforgiving, inhospitable place possible. While climbing the mountains, you are ambushed by figures in dark cloaks and demons made of ice as you attempt to cross a divide. A voice booms out over the howling wind. “You are not welcome here, mortals. All that awaits you is the embrace of death.” You can hardly see through the blizzard, but you are determined to make sure death embraces someone else. As you battle though both enemies and weather alike, you escape the rising storm of ice to find some semblance of shelter in a cave. A glowing white orb sits behind the crytalline demons occupying the cave. The pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking our passage to the peak. You destroy the orb and the screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak. At this altitude, without a cloud in sight, you find yourself looking out over the horizon, marveling at the wondrous expanse of mountains and the forests and plains beyond them. You can even see the faint outline of Gloomhaven in the distance.",
                3: "With the ice altar destroyed, climbing the rest of the way up the mountain is thankfully uneventful. You are almost enjoying yourself, admiring the view of the entire countryside, when the view grows suddenly dark, despite it only being midday. You are very close to the peak now, and you surmise that this development has something to do with the evil presence at the summit. A sharp screeching rings out, and you crouch down squinting through the darkness. Near the peak you see many dark shapes scrabbling and writhing, as if the mountain itself is alive. Squinting further, you notice that the writhing is moving down the mountain toward you. It seems your presence has not gone unnoticed. You ready your weapons and prepare to fight your way to the peak. You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you. “You dare approach my nest?” You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. “I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!” You battle the demon and its 'children' until finally, the demon can take no more. The giant demon screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."

If you bring the scepter to the Voice's chamber, you can renew the binding and silence this damned voice once and for all.",
                2: "You decided that the easiest way to silence The Voice was just to give it what it wants. The Voice has been freed and no longer inhabits the Echo Chamber.",

I understand, but what you are doing will only lead to disaster and ruin. That scepter was not created to strengthen my prison. I created it! I used it to imprison one of my greatest foes—a being of death and hatred. I do not know what will happen when you bring that thing to my chamber, but I can guarantee you no good will come of it!” Shut up shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP! You blocked the Voice’s lies from your mind and before the Voice could speak another word, you raised up the scepter and channeled its power. A black fog oozed from it and enveloped you. The Voice screamed out once more, but there was no coherence in the sound—only pain. The fog began to dissipate and, for a moment, you felt relief, until you saw that you were not in the Echo Chamber anymore, but some dark and hostile realm instead. The Voice rang out again, but somehow it was different: “The power of the Voice is mine! You will be the first I destroy with it!” And try it did, but after a fierce battle, you severed the Voice's vocal chords. The Voice will never speak again."

Fighting through the first wave of soldiers, you arrive at a clearing. The rest of the guards are standing around a very large mechanical cannon. The guards fire the cannon at you many times, but you endure the volleys and slay the guards as you advance. Eventually, the cannon lies ruined and broken at your feet, and with it, any hope the rebels had of assaulting Gloomhaven. The guards who are still alive scatter, and you return to the demon-ruled Gloomhaven victorious. “So you have crushed the pathetic upstarts?” You stand before one of the Prime Demon’s liaisons. “Good.

Once we are properly armed and have you at our side, the demons won’t stand a chance. Most of the citizenry are unhappy under their occupation and will rise up when they see we have the advantage.” Three days later you sneak into the Ghost Fortress, and storm the armory. You secure the last of the armory stock just as the rebel fighters break through into the fortress. Cleaning out the demons from the rest of the building becomes short work after that. With a strong foothold in the town and the populace on your side, the tide quickly turns against the demons. The battle is still long and difficult, as more forces continue to arrive from the elemental plane, but it ultimately only brings the residents of Gloomhaven into stronger unison, fighting against a common enemy. And with you no longer fighting for them, the demon force eventually relents and retreats back to its own plane. The next weeks are difficult, as the citizenry rebuilds the walls and everything else that had been destroyed in the prolonged battle. They also need time to trust you again after your ill-conceived betrayal. But Gloomhaven does bounce back in time. It is full of resilient people and the port is vital for trade. It never feels quite the same afterward, but at some point, it at least still feels like home."

Hail resolutely points you toward the whirling mass of sand, handing you a pouch to protect you from its ill effects. Entering the vortex is immensely painful but the pouch fills you with a dull numbness. Eventually, you find yourself standing in a large stone room covered in odd runic symbols. There is an unearthly coldness to it, and the dull pain of the Void persists. “Those brave enough to enter here will be the first torn apart.” An arresting voice echoes through the chamber around you. “The rest I will hunt down like game and devour, but I do think I will enjoy this more.” As your eyes adjust to the low light, you see a shadowy form in the center of the room. With time, you are able to focus on the image of an Aesther with two long, thin blades. “I have waited many years to reap this harvest,” he says with a wicked grin. “At one time, I had convinced myself that I would find more delight in watching you slowly kill yourselves, but with my meddling brethren and the deaths of my wards, I have returned to my original design. “I am not unhappy at the development. Even the patience of an immortal has its limits.” The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance. “Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?” The battle rages for what feels like eons, but finally, two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face. “How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?” The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings. “You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!” At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence. The dull pain subsides, and you ascend the staircase to a bright, clear sky. The tremors and vortex of black sand are gone and all those gathered around the Void look very relieved when you emerge from the confrontation. You let the people know that whatever calamity had descended upon them has now been averted. They cheer and celebrate your strength."
